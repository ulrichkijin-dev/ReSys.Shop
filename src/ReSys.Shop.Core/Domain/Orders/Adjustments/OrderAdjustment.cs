/// Represents a financial adjustment applied to an order. The adjustment can be scoped to the entire order,
/// a specific line item, or a shipment. This entity consolidates all adjustments into a single model.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// KEY PATTERN:
/// OrderAdjustment is an owned entity of the Order aggregate and is accessed only through the Order.Adjustments collection.
/// This consolidation simplifies promotion application, tax calculation, and totals computation.
/// 
/// ADJUSTMENT SCOPES:
/// • Order: An adjustment applied to the entire order (e.g., "$10 off orders over $100").
/// • LineItem: An adjustment applied to a specific line item (e.g., "20% off this product"). `LineItemId` must be set.
/// • Shipping: An adjustment applied to the shipping cost (e.g., "Free shipping promotion").
///
/// FINANCIAL & PROMOTION IMPACT:
/// The financial and promotion tracking semantics remain the same, but are now unified. All calculations
/// are performed on the single `Order.Adjustments` collection, filtering by `Scope` where necessary.
/// </remarks>
