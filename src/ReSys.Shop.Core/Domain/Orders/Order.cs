/// <summary>
/// Represents an order in the e-commerce system. This is the aggregate root for the Orders bounded context.
/// 
/// The Order manages the entire customer purchase lifecycle from initial shopping cart through payment
/// and fulfillment. It orchestrates interactions with multiple sub-domains (Catalog, Shipping, Payments,
/// Inventories, Promotions) while maintaining invariant consistency and business rule enforcement.
/// 
/// <example>
/// <code>
/// // Create a new order
/// var orderResult = Order.Create(storeId: store.Id, currency: "USD", userId: user.Id);
/// if (orderResult.IsError) return Problem(orderResult.FirstError);
/// var order = orderResult.Value;
/// 
/// // Add items to cart
/// var addResult = order.AddLineItem(variant: selectedVariant, quantity: 2);
/// if (addResult.IsError) return Problem(addResult.FirstError);
/// 
/// // Set addresses and progress through states
/// await order.SetShippingAddress(address);
/// await order.SetBillingAddress(address);
/// var toDeliveryResult = order.Next(); // Cart → Address → Delivery
/// 
/// // Select shipping and apply promotion
/// order.SetShippingMethod(shippingMethod);
/// order.ApplyPromotion(promotion, code: "SUMMER20");
/// var toPaymentResult = order.Next(); // Delivery → Payment
/// 
/// // Process payment and complete
/// order.AddPayment(amountCents, paymentMethodId, paymentType);
/// var completeResult = order.Complete(); // Payment → Confirm → Complete
/// 
/// // Save changes (events published after SaveChangesAsync)
///  _dbContext.Set<Order>().Add(order);
/// await _dbContext.SaveChangesAsync();
/// </code>
/// </example>
/// 
/// <remarks>
/// KEY PATTERNS:
/// • Factory Method: Use Order.Create() for safe instantiation with validation
/// • State Machine: Use Next() for valid state transitions (Cart → Complete)
/// • ErrorOr: All operations return ErrorOr for railway-oriented error handling
/// • Domain Events: Significant changes published as domain events for decoupled integration
/// • Owned Entities: LineItems, Adjustments, Payments accessible only through Order aggregate
/// 
/// DIGITAL VS PHYSICAL ORDERS:
/// • Digital: No shipping address/method/fulfillment location required
/// • Physical: Addresses and shipping method mandatory before Payment state
/// • Fully digital orders auto-skip Address and Delivery validation
/// 
/// FINANCIAL PRECISION:
/// • All monetary values stored in cents (decimal) to avoid floating-point precision issues
/// • Totals automatically recalculated after changes: ItemTotal + ShipmentTotal + AdjustmentTotal
/// • Adjustments can be negative (discounts) or positive (taxes, fees)
/// 
/// PROMOTION HANDLING:
/// • Single promotion per order (replaces previous if reapplied)
/// • Coupon codes validated if promotion requires
/// • Adjustments distributed at order-level or line-item level as configured
/// • Non-promotion adjustments preserved when switching promotions
/// 
/// INVENTORY COORDINATION:
/// • Domain events signal inventory operations: FinalizeInventory (completion), ReleaseInventory (cancellation)
/// • Event handlers coordinate with Inventories bounded context
/// • Multi-location fulfillment via FulfillmentLocation assignment
