/// <summary>
/// Provides a centralized collection of constant strings representing various auditable actions
/// performed within the application. These constants are used to categorize and describe events
/// recorded in audit logs, ensuring consistency and searchability of audit trails.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This static class groups audit actions by functional area (e.g., CRUD, Order, Payment, Inventory, User).
/// Using these constants helps maintain a standardized vocabulary for auditing, making it easier to
/// filter, analyze, and report on system activities.
///
/// <strong>Example Usage:</strong>
/// <code>
/// // When creating an audit log entry
/// var auditLog = AuditLog.Create(
///     userId: "admin",
///     entityType: "Product",
///     entityId: productId,
///     action: AuditAction.Created,
///     description: "New product 'Laptop Pro' added.");
/// </code>
