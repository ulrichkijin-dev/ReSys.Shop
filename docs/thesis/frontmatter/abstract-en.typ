    This thesis presents the design and implementation of a web-based student management system for Can Tho University. The study addresses the inefficiency of manual student record management by developing a modern web application using React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. The system implements RESTful APIs and utilizes MongoDB for data storage.

    Key features include student registration management, grade tracking, course enrollment, and automated report generation. The research methodology encompasses requirements analysis, system design using UML diagrams, agile development, and comprehensive testing. Results demonstrate improved efficiency with a 70% reduction in processing time and a 95% user satisfaction rate.
