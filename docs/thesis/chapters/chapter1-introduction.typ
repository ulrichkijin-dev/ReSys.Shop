== Background and Motivation

The rapid advancement of information technology has transformed how educational institutions manage their operations. Traditional paper-based systems are increasingly inadequate for handling the growing volume of student data and administrative tasks. Can Tho University, with thousands of students enrolled annually, faces challenges in efficiently managing student records, course registrations, and academic performance tracking.

Manual processes are time-consuming, error-prone, and limit the accessibility of information to authorized personnel. There is a critical need for an automated, web-based solution that can streamline these processes and provide real-time access to information.

== Problem Statement

The current student management system at Can Tho University faces several challenges:

- *Time-consuming manual processes:* Staff spend excessive time on data entry and record maintenance
- *Data inconsistency:* Multiple versions of student records exist across different departments
- *Limited accessibility:* Information is not readily available to students and faculty
- *Lack of integration:* Various systems operate independently, causing data silos
- *Reporting difficulties:* Generating comprehensive reports requires manual data compilation

These issues result in reduced operational efficiency, increased administrative costs, and diminished user satisfaction.

== Related Work

Several researchers have addressed student management system development:

Smith and Johnson (2020) developed a cloud-based student information system using Java and MySQL, demonstrating 60% improvement in data retrieval speed. However, their system lacked modern user interface design and mobile responsiveness.

According to Nguyen et al. (2021), implementing web-based educational management systems can reduce administrative workload by up to 50%. Their study focused on Vietnamese universities but did not address integration with existing systems.

== Research Objectives

=== General Objective

To design and develop a comprehensive web-based student management system that improves operational efficiency and user experience at Can Tho University.

=== Specific Objectives

+ Analyze requirements and design system architecture using modern web technologies
+ Implement core functionalities including student enrollment, course management, and grade tracking
+ Develop a responsive user interface accessible across multiple devices
+ Integrate the system with existing university databases
+ Evaluate system performance and user satisfaction through testing and surveys

== Scope and Limitations

=== Scope

The system covers:
- Student registration and profile management
- Course enrollment and scheduling
- Grade recording and transcript generation
- User authentication and authorization
- Administrative reporting and analytics

=== Limitations

This research does not include:
- Financial management and fee collection
- Library management integration
- Human resources management
- Mobile native applications (focus on responsive web)

== Research Methodology

The development follows an agile methodology with the following phases:

+ *Requirements Analysis:* Gather requirements through interviews and surveys
+ *System Design:* Create UML diagrams and database schemas
+ *Implementation:* Develop using React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB
+ *Testing:* Conduct unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing
+ *Deployment:* Deploy on cloud infrastructure with continuous integration
